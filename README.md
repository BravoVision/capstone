# "Eventually..." Web Application


## App Description

Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow?

Your new favorite web application, "Eventually...", helps with creating a simple to-do list for your everyday needs. 

If your ability to remember song lyrics from the 90’s is better than your ability to remember why you walked into the kitchen, then this is the app for you! Sign up, add your tasks, update them as needed, and delete them when you're no longer bothered with doing stuff.

Come to the place that helps you keep track of life and handle things, eventually…
